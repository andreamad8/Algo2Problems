\section*{Randomized min-cut algorithm}
Consider the randomized min-cut algorithm discussed
in class. We have seen that its probability of success is at least $\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}$, where $n$ is the number of its vertices.
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe how to implement the algorithm when the graph is represented by adjacency
lists, and analyze its running time. In particular, a contraction step can
be done in O(n) time.
\item A weighted graph has a weight w(e) on each edge e, which is a positive real
number. The min-cut in this case is meant to be min-weighted cut, where the
sum of the weights in the cut edges is minimum. Describe how to extend the $\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}$[hint: define the weighted degree of a node]
\item Show that running the algorithm multiple times independently at random, and
taking the minimum among the min-cuts thus produced, the probability of success
can be made at least 1 âˆ’ 1/nc
for a constant c > 0 (hence, with high probability).
\end{itemize}
