\section*{Hashing sets}
Your company has a database $S \in U$ of keys. For this database, it uses a randomly chosen hash function $h$ from a universal family $H$ (as seen in class); it also keeps a bit vector $B_S$ of $m$ entries, initialized to zeroes, which are then set $B_S[h(k)] = 1$ for every $k \in S$ (note that collisions may happen). Unfortunately, the database $S$ has been lost, thus only $B_S$ and $h$ are known, and the rest is no more accessible. Now, given $k \in U$, how can you establish if $k$ was in $S$ or not? What is the probability of error? Under the hypothesis that $m \geq c|S|$ for some $c > 1$ (note: we do not know the actual values of $c$ and $|S|$) can you estimate the size $|S|$, i.e. the size of $S$, looking at just $h$ and $B_S$? What is the probability of error? Note that $S$ is no more accessible as it disappeared.\\

\textbf{SOLUTION}
\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{a)}] To check whether $k\in U$ belong to $S$, we simply check $B_S[h(k)]=1$. The probability of error is equal to $P(error)=1-(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{|S|}$. This problem is similar to the "Birthday paradox" (i.e. fixed a day how many people are born on the same day). In word: the probability of a collision is $\frac{1}{m}$, thus the probability to do not have a collision is $(1-\frac{1}{m})$. If we have $|S|$ key the probability do not have any collision is $(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{|S|}$. Therefore the probability to have a collision is: $1-(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{|S|}$. That is, the probability that there is at least one collision with of the key is S, the probability that $\exists j\in S : h(k)=h(j)$ but $j\neq k$ with $k \in U$.
\item[\textbf{b)}] To estimate the size of $S$, we first create an indicator variable $X=\sum_{i=0}^{m-1}X_i$ where
\begin{equation}
X_{i} =  
\begin{cases} 
1 \qquad \textsc{if }B_S[h(k)]=1\\
0 \qquad \textsc{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\nonumber
\end{equation}
Than the expectation $E[X]$ represents the expected number of $1$ in the $B_s$ table. To calculate the expectation we need to estimate the $P(B_S[h(k)]=1)$, that, by the point a), is $1-(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{|S|}$. Since we do not know $|S|$ we use the hypothesis, that is $|S|\leq \frac{m}{c}$. Therefore we have:
\begin{equation}
P(B_S[h(k)]=1)=1-(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{|S|} \leq 1-(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{\frac{m}{c}}
\nonumber
\end{equation}
Hence we have $E[X]= \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 1-(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{\frac{m}{c}}=m-m(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{\frac{m}{c}}$. Now we have got a bound for $|S|$: $E[X]\leq|S|\leq \frac{m}{c}$.
\end{itemize}
