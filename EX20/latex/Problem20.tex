\section*{Wrong greedy for minimum vertex cove}
Find an example of (family of) graphs for which the following greedy approach fails to give a 2-approximation for the minimum vertex cover problem (and prove why this is so). 
Start out with an empty $\tilde{S}$.
Choose each time a vertex $v$ with the largest number of incident edges in the current graph.
Add $v$ to $\tilde{S}$ and remove its incident edges.
Repeat the process on the resulting graph as long as there are edges in it.
Return $|\tilde{S}|$ as the approximation of the minimal size of a vertex cover for the original input graph.

Generalize your argument to show that the above greedy algorithm cannot actually provide an r-approximation for any given constant $r > 1$.

\textbf{Solution}
\\
\\
We will use a partitioned graph $G = (V, E)$.
The set of vertices $V$ is divided in two partitions $A$ and $B$.
The graph is such that all the edges connect two vertices one from $A$ and one from $B$ (i.e. we don't allow intra-partition edges).

In this way we can see that the degree of $A$ and $B$ are the same (we define the degree of a set of vertices to be the sum of the degrees of the vertices), they are exactly $|E|$.
We name $n = |B|$ and $m = |A|$.
Note that if the graph is connected, one minimum vertex cover is exactly $A$ or $B$ depending on which is the minimum between $m$ and $n$.

We will build the graph in a way such that the minimum vertex cover is $B$ (i.e. $m > n$), but the greedy algorithm can choose all the nodes of $A$ as minimum vertex cover, and we will show that $m > 2n$ if $n$ is sufficiently large.

\
%
%
%Consider a graph with $k = |E|$ edges, the best way to build $B$ is to equally distribute the edges on its nodes in order to minimize the maximum degree of each node.
%In $A$ instead we need to distribute the edges in a very non-balanced way between the its nodes, in order to have few nodes with .
The idea is to fix $n$ and then build the graph having $m$ depending somehow on $n$, such that the $m$ node of $A$ can be chosen by the algorithm. 

The construction works this way:
\begin{enumerate}
\item set $i = 1$, $A = \{\}$
\item create $\lfloor n/i \rfloor$ new nodes with degree $i$ 
\item insert the nodes obtained in $A$
\item connect each edge of those nodes to a \emph{different} node in $B$ following a round robin policy \footnote{this roundrobin policy is to be considered over the whole execution of the algorithm, i.e. at iteration $i$ we will start connecting the new edges to the node in $B$ ``immediatly after'' the lastone connected at the $i-1$ iteration}
\item increase $i$, if it is not greater than $n$ then go to $1.$ else you are done
\end{enumerate}

Following this construction the following facts are true:

\paragraph{fact 1}At the $i$-th iteration we add a total number of new edges \emph{less or equal} than $n$, each one connected to a different node in $B$.

\paragraph{fatc 2}Since we distribute the edges in a uniform way on the nodes in $B$, the degree of a node in $B$ at iteration $i$ will be less or equal than $i$ (i.e. for each iteration we add zero or one edge to each node in $B$)
\paragraph{fact 3}A node created at iteartion $i$ has exactly degree $i$.

\

\noindent Now let's study what happends when we run the greedy algorithm on the graph obtained in the proposed way.

At the very beginning this algorithm will select a node between one of the nodes in $B$ (each of them has degpee less or equal than $n$) and the last node inserted in $A$, which has degree $n$ exactly.
If the greedy algorithm select this last node from $A$ the algorithm will remove the edges of this node (and the node itself) and so each node in $B$ will have its degree decreased by $1$.
The remaining graph will be the one present during the $(n-1)$-th iteration of the construction!

\

By construction we know that at iteration $n-1$ we have $\lfloor n/n-1 \rfloor$ nodes in $A$ each of which with degree $n-1$.
From \textbf{fact2} we also know that at the $n-1$-th iteration the maximum degree of the nodes in $B$  is \emph{at most} $n-1$.

\noindent
We are in the same situation of the very beginning and the greedy algorithm can choose again a node in $A$.

With the same reasoning of above we can observe that at any iteration of the greedy algorithm the graph will have a node in $A$ which has degree greater or equal than the degree of each node in $B$. \footnote{of course the greedy algorithm could select a note in $B$ as well, but this will not affect our argument because we are trying to prove that there is a sequence of possible wrong choices}

Therefore the greedy algorithm running on a graph constructed as described above can return $m = |A|$ as approximation of the MVC of that graph, i.e. there exists a sequence of choices that will select all the nodes in $A$. 
If $m > 2n$ the result will not be a $2$-approximation of MVC.
We can see that this happends with $n \geq 6$

Infact we can see that with our construction $A$ will have $m = 6 + \frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{3} + \lfloor \frac{6}{4} \rfloor +   \lfloor \frac{6}{5} \rfloor + 1 = 14$ nodes and so the greedy algorithm can return $14$ that is not a 2 approximation of the MVC problem.

\
\

\textbf{GENERALIZATION}

\
\

We can generalize the solution given by the greedy algorithm running on our consctructed graph so that we can see that for any $r > 1$ the algorithm can provide a non valid $r$-approximation.

We want to show that for any $r>1$ there exist $n$ such that the greedy algorithm will not provide an $r$-approximation.
 
Using our graph construction method, given $n$ as the correct minimal size of the MVC, the number of nodes in $A$ will be 
\[
m = \sum_{i=1}^n \lfloor n/i \rfloor
\]

so we want to show that 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \lfloor n/i \rfloor > rn
\]


We can observe that 

\[
\sum_{i=1}^n \lfloor \frac{n}{i} \rfloor > \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{n}{i} - 1) = n \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} - n = n(-1 + \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{n}) \approx n \log{n} 
\]

Since $nlogn$ grows faster than $rn$, given $r>1$ there will always be a value of $n$ that will cause the greedy algorithm to provide a value $m = \sum_{i=1}^n \lfloor n/i \rfloor > rn$ that is not an $r$-approximation.
