# Algo2Problems
This a repo to keep track to some solution of the exercize of the Algorithm 2 course. Please push you solution, either code or any kind of text file (e.g. latex, markdown, word, plain txt), in the folder corresponding to the right exercise. We will try to keep the best solution in the pdf named: "ProblemX_SOLUTION.pdf". In this file there could be more than one solution.
## CURRENT PROBLEMS
* EX1: Range updates. **SOLVED**
* EX2: Depth of a node in a random search tree.**SOLVED** (Check second solution for Chernoffâ€™s bounds.) 
* EX3: Karp-Rabin fingerprinting on strings. **SOLVED**
* EX4: Hashing sets. **SOLVED** (Notice that the professor changed the exercize text)
* EX5: Family of uniform hash functions. **STILL ON GOING** (we have a partial solution, soon we will try to upload it) 

## POLICY
If you believe that the proposed solutions are wrong, or there are mistakes, or you have a better solution, please do not esitate to review the already existing file, or upload your solution. Actually, if you want to upload your solution anyway, you are welcome.
Last but not least, if you modify or find any mistake, please create and issue, in order to let everyone know about that.
