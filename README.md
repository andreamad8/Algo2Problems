# Algo2Problems
This a repo to keep track to some solution of the exercize of the Algorithm 2 course. Please push you solution, either code or any kind of text file (e.g. latex, markdown, word, plain txt), in the folder corresponding to the right exercise. We will try to keep the best solution in the pdf named: "ProblemX_SOLUTION.pdf". In this file there could be more than one solution.
## CURRENT PROBLEMS
* EX1: Range updates. **SOLVED**
* EX2: Depth of a node in a random search tree.**SOLVED** (Check second solution for Chernoffâ€™s bounds.) 
* EX3: Karp-Rabin fingerprinting on strings. **SOLVED**
* EX4: Hashing sets. **SOLVED** (Notice that the professor changed the exercize text)
* EX5: Family of uniform hash functions. **STILL ON GOING** (we have a partial solution, soon we will try to upload it)
